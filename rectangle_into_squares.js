/*
The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

alternative text

Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

You will be given two dimensions

a positive integer length
a positive integer width
You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the squares.

Examples in general form:
(depending on the language)

  sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  
  You can see examples for your language in **"SAMPLE TESTS".**
Notes:
lng == wdth as a starting case would be an entirely different problem and the drawing is planned to be interpreted with lng != wdth. (See kata, Square into Squares. Protect trees! http://www.codewars.com/kata/54eb33e5bc1a25440d000891 for this problem).

When the initial parameters are so that lng == wdth, the solution [lng] would be the most obvious but not in the spirit of this kata so, in that case, return None/nil/null/Nothing or return {} with C++, [] with Perl, Raku.

In that case the returned structure of C will have its sz component equal to 0.

Return the string "nil" with Bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran.

function sqInRect(lng, wdth) {
  let short;
  let array = [];
  if (lng === wdth) return null;

  while (lng > 0 && wdth > 0) {
    short = lng < wdth ? lng : wdth;
    array.push(short);

    if (short === wdth) lng -= short;
    else wdth -= short;
  }

  return array;
}
